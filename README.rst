This is a coding evaluation exercise to be completed by candidates applying for
a software development position at Sweft. The exercise is simple because doing
something simple well requires a well-rounded set of skills. We recognize that
your time is valuable and a simple exercise is more respectful of your time.

Exercise Instructions
---------------------
#. Fork this repo.
#. Complete the exercise.
#. When you are done with the exercise, submit a pull request.
#. Send us an email with the url to the pull request indicating that you are
done and the solution is ready for code review.

Exercise Scope
--------------
#. Build a React single-page app and a Java Spring Boot web service. The
   front-end presents the user with two text input controls that can be
   submitted to the backend service. The backend service computes the edit
   distance between the two strings using any methodology you wish. The computed
   output is then displayed to the end user in the front-end.
#. Write automated tests for your code.
#. Write instructions for the reviewer that explain how to build your code, run
   your tests, and run the application.

You must meet the following constraints in order for your submission to be
considered valid:

#. The front-end must be a single page app using React.
#. The data exchanged between front-end and back-end must be in JSON.

Your submission will be evaluated against the following criteria:

#. Your code is well organized
#. Your code is testable
#. Both your front-end and back-end code is covered by automated tests
#. Your commits and commit messages are thoughtful, clear, and logically grouped
   and ordered for easy code review
